MVP Front-End Application Requirements: 
Project Due Date: On or before Saturday, May 23, 2020. 

Deployment: It should be deployed to Github pages and the deployed link should be sent to Brent Watson (bwatson@2U.com) and Beatrice Wilson (bwilson1@2U.com). This will be reviewed and sent to the Academic team for grading. 

● Create a front-end application using the following technologies: 

○ HTML, CSS (or Bootstrap), jQuery, and 1 API integration using AJAX. 

○ For the API integration we can use the bands in town api, giphy api, or OMDB api 
○ Below we will provide screenshots of how we would like the student to go about the API requests, for each idea. 
■ We will provide the API key and the endpoint that needs to be hit to get data. The response object needs to return information about what the user’s request 
■ So the applications are event driven, meaning: 
■ As a user, I am able to navigate to a search bar and type in a name of a band and click enter and I should be able to see if my band is performing, the location, the price, a cover band poster and a redirection to the website to purchase tickets 
■ As a user, I am able to navigate to a search bar and type in the name of a movie I am interested in and click enter, and I should be able to see specific information about my search and then finally append that information on to the screen. Information (properties) we want to be able to see is, movie title, year of release, actors, plot, and a poster! 
■ As a user, I am able to navigate to a search bar and type in the name of a movie and click enter I am interested in, and I should be able to see specific information about my search and then finally append that information on to the screen. Information (properties) we want to be able to see is, movie title, year of release, actors, plot, and a poster! 
■ Once we are able to test out our api’s and make sure we get a response object with all the properties, the student should open up the chrome development tools in their respective brownser and figure out which properties (data) they want appended on the screen. The last part is being able to dynamically append those elements on the page and have them represent the data we got back from the response object.
